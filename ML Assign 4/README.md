The final submitted assignment (folder - ML Assign 1) contains these files as follows : 
    Four satellite images

    1) 1.jpg 

    2) 2.jpg 

    3) 3.jpg 

    4) 4.jpg 

    5) ML LAB Assignment 4 K Means Clustering.ipynb - jupyter notebook file containing implementation of K Means Clustering
    
    6) ASSIGNMENT_4.py - .ipynb converted to .py for use as per choice
    
    7) ML LAB Assignment 4 K Means Clustering.pdf - pdf format of jupyter notebook for reference

For running the jupyter notebook or the python file you need some libraries installed. For that open up a command prompt
and type these commands one by one
    a) pip install numpy
    b) pip install matplotlib
    c) pip install pillow

For running the cells in ML LAB Assignment 4 K Means Clustering.ipynb use "Shift + Enter"

For running the python file ASSIGNMENT_4.py use commmand "python ASSIGNMENT_4.py" on a command line

After running each cell in the jupyter notebook (or after running the .py file) you will notice 4 extra image files being created :
    a) blank.png - blank file created to form the final output
    
    b) output2.jpg - output image file corresponding to k=2
    
    c) output3.jpg - output image file corresponding to k=3
    
    d) output4.jpg - output image file corresponding to k=4

There is also a sample output folder which contains sample outputs (sample output image produced during testing the code)
