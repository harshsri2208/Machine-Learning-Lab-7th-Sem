The final submitted assignment (folder - ML Assign 2) contains these files as follows : 

    1) 1.jpg - Image file to obtain pixel values of R from RGB

    2) 2.jpg - Image file to obtain pixel values of G from RGB

    3) 3.jpg - Image file to obtain pixel values of B from RGB

    4) 4.jpg - Image file to obtain pixel values of I

    5) ML Lab_Assignment 2_PCA.ipynb - jupyter notebook file containing implementation of PCA and output images for four different eigenvectors calculated
    
    6) Assignment_2.py - .ipynb converted to .py for use as per choice
    
    7) ML Lab_Assignment 2_PCA.pdf - pdf format of jupyter notebook for reference

For running the jupyter notebook or the python file you need some libraries installed. For that open up a command prompt
and type these commands one by one

    a) pip install numpy
    b) pip install matplotlib
    c) pip install pillow
    d) pip install opencv-python

For running the cells in ML Lab_Assignment 2_PCA.ipynb use "Shift + Enter"

For running the python file Assignment2.py use commmand "python Assignment2.py" on a command line

After running each cell in the jupyter notebook (or after running the .py file) you will notice 4 blanks image files being created and four final output images:

    a) blank1.png, blank2.png, blank3.png, blank4.png - blank files created to form the final output
    
    b) pca_output1.png - output image cooresponding to highest eigenvalue
    
    c) pca_output2.png - output image cooresponding to second highest eigenvalue
    
    d) pca_output3.png - output image cooresponding to second lowest eigenvalue
    
    e) pca_output4.png - output image cooresponding to lowest eigenvalue

There is also a sample output folder which contains output images (sample output images produced during testing the code)
