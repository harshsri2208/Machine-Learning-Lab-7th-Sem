The final submitted assignment (folder - ML Assign 3) contains these files as follows : 

    1) facial_data - folder containing at&t dataset

    2) Facial Recognition PCA.ipynb - jupyter notebook implementation of image face recognition

    3) Facial Recognition PCA.pdf - jupyter notebook converted to pdf

    4) assign3.py - jupyter notebook converted to python file for running as per requirement

For running the jupyter notebook or the python file you need some libraries installed. For that open up a command prompt
and type these commands one by one

    a) pip install numpy
    b) pip install matplotlib
    c) pip install pillow
    d) pip install opencv-python

For running the cells in Facial Recognition PCA.ipynb use "Shift + Enter"

For running the python file assign3.py use commmand "python assign3.py" on a command line

After running each cell in the jupyter notebook (or after running the .py file) you will notice 4 plots being created for accuracy vs k for cases 90-10, 80-20 and 60-40 train test splits
